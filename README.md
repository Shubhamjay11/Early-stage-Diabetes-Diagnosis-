# Early-stage-Diabetes-Diagnosis
Using machine learning to determine if a patient has diabetes or not. applied data cleansing, modelling, visualisation, and cross validation.  

Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.

Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by a doctor.The data set contains 520 patient records in which 320 have diabetes and 200 does not have diabetes. The
"Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into diabetes patient (Diabetes Diagnosis) or not .
